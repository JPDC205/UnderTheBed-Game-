# UnderTheBed-Game-

Under The Bed was a 2DGame developed by my group and I in the first semester of my MSc in Games. It was developed in Unity and its a top-down exploration game.

To play just unzip the folder and run the executable (P.S. currently there is no exit button, so to exit use alt+F4)

This was ateam group and my responsibilities were:
- develop inventory system
- integration between scenes
- UI development
- Light system
- Overall World design and set up
- Fixing bugs
